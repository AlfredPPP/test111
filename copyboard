"How can I programmatically obtain the version of an automation or directly download the latest automation as a .gms file using Python code? I am developing an automation script in Python that needs to call the latest version of another automation (i.e., .gms file). For instance, I have an automation called '115372_DMH daily maintain'. Typically, I manually access the GMAS Automation Library website to get the latest version information and download the latest version. I want to know if there is an official method (such as a wrapped API interface) to access this information in Python code, rather than using the request+cookie method, which is technically challenging and unofficial."
