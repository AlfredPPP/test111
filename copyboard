Got it üëç Let me help you phrase this in clear English so it can go into your documentation.
Here‚Äôs a structured explanation of the logic for how data flows from the parse interface to the update interface:

Data Submission and Synchronization Logic
	1.	Data Preparation in Parse Interface
	‚Ä¢	In the parse interface, users parse and validate business data.
	‚Ä¢	Once the data passes validation, the user can click the Submit button.
	‚Ä¢	During submission, the user is prompted to provide key identifiers (such as Client ID, Asset ID, and other header information) to accompany the business data.
	‚Ä¢	The submission package consists of:
	‚Ä¢	The business data payload (not fully visible in the UI)
	‚Ä¢	The header identifiers (e.g., Client ID, Asset ID)
	2.	Transfer to Update Interface
	‚Ä¢	After submission, the data is sent from the parse interface to the update interface.
	‚Ä¢	The update interface maintains a table widget where each row represents one record. Each row visibly displays only a subset of fields (such as Client ID and Asset ID), while the corresponding detailed business data is stored in the background.
	3.	Data Integration in Update Interface
	‚Ä¢	When new data arrives from the parse interface, the update interface checks if the submitted Client ID + Asset ID combination already exists in the table:
	‚Ä¢	If a matching record exists:
	‚Ä¢	The system updates the corresponding row in the table with the new business data, replacing the previous background data.
	‚Ä¢	If no matching record exists:
	‚Ä¢	A new row is created in the table with the provided identifiers (e.g., Client ID, Asset ID), and the associated business data is stored in the background.
	4.	Resulting State
	‚Ä¢	The update interface table always reflects the current set of business records.
	‚Ä¢	Users see key identifiers in the table, while the full business data remains linked behind each row, updated or newly inserted depending on the submission.

Would you like me to make this sound more technical (like a system design doc) or more user-friendly (like an end-user manual)?
