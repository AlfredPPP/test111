Considering the complexity of OST system API operations and to improve the efficiency of ATO preparation, this automation plan will be implemented in a semi-automated manner for now:

1. Manually edit each fund on the OST system (approximately 1 minute per fund).
2. Use the OST API to export all relevant calculations in bulk and save them as XLSX files locally.
3. Manually locate the necessary remote file addresses, such as DRP, DRPQ, FS, etc., and input these addresses into the designated fields in the tool (this manual process may take 10-20 minutes depending on the organization of the clientâ€™s materials).
4. The tool parses the FS and OST calculation files, generates backups and shortcuts, and outputs any additional manual steps required.
5. Manually input the tool's results back into OST (approximately 5 minutes).
6. Manually add screenshots and calculation steps to the backup in the designated location (approximately 5 minutes).

Ideally, this process can reduce the time required for calculating an ITR to about 20 minutes. In the future, if full automation is considered, steps 3 and 5 can be reused without rewriting code.

Currently, we are in step 4, where FS PDF files are being parsed to extract financial components and their corresponding figures.
