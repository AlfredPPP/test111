你可以写一封简洁礼貌的提醒邮件，同时表达你对对方的理解和尊重。以下是一个示例：

---

**Subject:** Access Request Reminder

Dear Approver,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to kindly remind you that I have submitted an access request five days ago and I am still awaiting approval. This access is important for my ongoing work, and I would greatly appreciate it if you could kindly review it at your earliest convenience.

If there is anything else I need to provide or clarify, please let me know.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]

这样既表达了请求，同时也保持了礼貌与尊重，特别是对高于你级别的审批人。
