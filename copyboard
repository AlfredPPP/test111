Release Notes – Version X.Y.Z

Release Date: 2025-06-25
Summary: This release introduces key improvements in data handling and calculation logic, along with critical bug fixes to enhance system robustness and accuracy.

⸻

✨ Features
	•	Dynamic UR Code Handling:
Added support for single-digit UR codes. When a UR code in DMH contains only one digit, the system will now automatically prefix it with FUND to ensure proper identification.

⸻

🛠 Bug Fixes
	•	Resolved Network Latency Freeze:
Fixed an issue where the application could become unresponsive under poor network conditions.
	•	RTN_OF_CAP_COST_BASE_PCT Validation:
Corrected a bug that could cause RTN_OF_CAP_COST_BASE_PCT to exceed 1 under certain conditions.

⸻

🔧 Improvements
	•	Data Source Adjustment:
Updated data extraction to use the amount field instead of rate.
	•	Refined Shares Calculation Logic:
The shares value is now automatically derived from the gross amount rather than defaulting to 1.
	•	Enhanced TAP_CGT_CONCESSION_PCT Calculation:
Added missing logic to compute TAP_CGT_CONCESSION_PCT accurately based on available data.
