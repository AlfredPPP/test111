As I mentioned earlier, I contacted the person who sent the email, and they told me to reach out to the help desk to activate my MCH account. However, when I previously contacted the help desk, the live agent told me to go back to the person who sent the email, saying that my ID was not in the MCH system and that it wasn’t something they could handle. Now I’m being told again to contact the help desk… Could you please clarify whether you’re able to activate my account?
