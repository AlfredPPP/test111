After successful login, users are required to specify the Source Folder Path by pasting it into the input field marked as [1] in the screenshot below.

The selected folder should contain all source files intended for processing in the current session. Each source file is expected to correspond to a single master rate record.

Once the path has been entered, click the Submit button located to the right of the input field ([2]). The application will begin parsing the files, which may take some time depending on the number and size of the files.

Upon successful parsing, a summary table will populate below, displaying the extracted master rate information for each source file.

Note: The application currently supports only Excel files (.xlsx) as valid input sources.

Refer to the following screenshots for an example of the user interface and the expected folder structure.
