Yes, Scrapy has powerful capabilities for processing data as it’s being scraped, so it could be a good option to incorporate those additional steps directly within your Scrapy pipeline. Here’s a possible approach using Scrapy’s item pipeline:

Suggested Workflow with Scrapy

	1.	Spider Configuration: Configure your Scrapy spider to read from the config file and retrieve URLs for PDF files or web pages.
	2.	Item Pipeline: Set up a pipeline that will handle each step once the data is downloaded.
	•	Filter Tasks: If your spider identifies tasks as “done” or “pending,” you could perform the filtering step within the spider itself or the item pipeline.
	•	Save PDF to Folder: Save each downloaded PDF file to the specified folder.
	•	Parse PDF: Use PDF parsing code within the pipeline to extract content based on the regex patterns from the config.
	•	Database Storage: Save the parsed data to the database as the final step in the pipeline.

Example Structure in Scrapy

Here’s a rough outline of what this could look like in your items.py, spiders, and pipelines.py files:

Spider (my_spider.py)

import scrapy
import json

class MySpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = "pdf_spider"
    
    def __init__(self, config_path, *args, **kwargs):
        super(MySpider, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        with open(config_path) as f:
            config = json.load(f)
            self.task_list = config.get("tasks", [])

    def start_requests(self):
        for task in self.task_list:
            if not task.get("completed"):
                yield scrapy.Request(url=task["url"], meta={"task": task})

    def parse(self, response):
        task = response.meta["task"]
        # Assuming PDF URLs are already direct links
        pdf_url = response.url
        yield {"pdf_url": pdf_url, "task": task}

Pipeline (pipelines.py)

import os
import sqlite3
import re
import requests

class PDFPipeline:
    def __init__(self, config_path, db_path):
        self.config_path = config_path
        self.db_connection = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
        
    def process_item(self, item, spider):
        # Step 1: Save PDF
        pdf_content = requests.get(item['pdf_url']).content
        pdf_path = os.path.join("pdf_folder", os.path.basename(item['pdf_url']))
        with open(pdf_path, "wb") as pdf_file:
            pdf_file.write(pdf_content)
        
        # Step 2: Parse PDF
        parsed_data = self._parse_pdf(pdf_path, item['task'].get("regex"))

        # Step 3: Store in Database
        self._store_in_db(parsed_data)
        
        # Mark task as complete
        item["task"]["completed"] = True
        return item

    def _parse_pdf(self, pdf_path, regex_pattern):
        # Your PDF parsing logic, using regex_pattern to extract data
        # Example placeholder
        parsed_data = re.findall(regex_pattern, open(pdf_path, 'rb').read().decode('utf-8', errors='ignore'))
        return parsed_data

    def _store_in_db(self, parsed_data):
        # Code to insert parsed_data into the database
        pass

Settings (settings.py)

# Enable the pipeline
ITEM_PIPELINES = {
    'myproject.pipelines.PDFPipeline': 1,
}

# Pipeline configuration paths
PDF_PIPELINE_CONFIG_PATH = 'path/to/config.json'
PDF_PIPELINE_DB_PATH = 'path/to/database.db'

Advantages of This Approach

	•	Single Workflow: Scrapy handles crawling, downloading, parsing, and storing in one pipeline.
	•	Task Management: Your pipeline can directly mark tasks as complete and handle PDF parsing immediately, reducing external processing.
	•	Maintainability: Scrapy pipelines are modular, so it’s straightforward to adjust each step.

By managing everything within Scrapy, you keep your workflow compact, with clear responsibilities divided among the spider and pipeline components. This setup is also easier to manage when updating tasks or data extraction requirements in the future.
