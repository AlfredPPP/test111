Upon launching the application, users are prompted with a login interface. The first step is to select the intended role: Preparer or Reviewer.
	•	Preparer: Responsible for parsing and uploading master rate data from approved source files.
	•	Reviewer: Authorized to review and batch-approve multiple master rate records within the system.

Once a role is selected, the user’s Enterprise ID (EID) is automatically detected and pre-filled in the User ID field. This field is non-editable to ensure secure, identity-bound access—each user can only access the application with their own credentials.

The user must then enter a passcode, which typically includes a concatenated token (as required by DM protocols), and click Submit to complete the login process.

This authentication step ensures role-based access control and enforces identity verification in alignment with organizational security standards.
