About a week ago, I applied for user access to the McH and cmodq systems. I received an email confirming that my access request had been completed, but I still cannot log in to either system. I keep getting the error message: “invalid user ID or password.” I’m using the password format of my PIN + 6-digit RSA token.

I contacted the person who sent the confirmation email, and they showed me a screenshot confirming that my EID is listed as a user in both systems. They suggested I reach out to the help desk. However, the help desk told me this issue is not within their scope.

The person who originally emailed me then recommended that I submit a SNOW ticket to resolve the issue—so here I am.
