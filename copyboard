Step 3: Retrieve CUSIP and Perform Data Validation

Once the initial parsing is complete and the preliminary data table is displayed (as described in Step 2), users should click the Get CUSIP button to initiate the next phase of validation and enrichment.

Upon clicking Get CUSIP, the application performs the following actions:
	•	Automatically queries the DMH platform using the UR code to retrieve corresponding Asset IDs from the Fund Setup and Class Setup modules.
	•	Displays the retrieved Asset IDs directly in the data table.
	•	Filters and unchecks invalid entries based on a set of business rules. Data rows may be excluded for reasons including:
	•	Duplicate master rate information found in multiple source files.
	•	File corruption or non-compliance with the expected High Trust System format.
	•	Inconsistencies between DPU values in the source file and those in the DMH master rate database.
	•	Variance thresholds being exceeded during validation.

Only rows that remain checked after this process are considered valid and ready for upload to DMH. All others are automatically deselected to prevent erroneous data submission.

Step 4: Upload to DMH and Final Review

To submit the validated data, users must click the Upload Data button. The application will then attempt to upload all currently selected rows to the DMH Master Rate system.

For each record, the Status column in the data table will display the result of the upload:
	•	Success: The data was uploaded successfully and should now be visible in DMH as a Pending Approval entry.
	•	Failure: The upload was not successful. The status column will show the specific error (e.g., excessive variance, invalid data structure, or unknown system error).

In case of failure, users should manually investigate the corresponding record by referencing the Asset ID, and may need to update the DMH Master Rate directly.

To support troubleshooting:
	•	The View Log button (located in the bottom-left corner of the interface) allows users to access runtime logs for detailed error tracking. These logs can be shared with the development team for further assistance.
	•	The Restart button (next to View Log) allows users to reset the application state and repeat the entire process from Step 1, without requiring re-authentication.

This concludes all the core functionality available within the Preparer Interface.
